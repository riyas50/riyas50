# 👋 Hi, I'm Riyas Aboobaker

## 🔧 Multi-Hat Developer | 🚀 Serial Entrepreneur | 🌍 UAE ↔ India

### About Me
I'm a Gen X developer who's been coding since the VB6 days and never stopped learning. By day, I lead IT services in Dubai. By night (and weekends), I build and maintain multiple tech businesses across India and the UAE.

**What makes me tick:** Turning real-world business problems into elegant technical solutions.

### 🎯 Current Focus
- **Asset Tracking Systems**: Modernizing legacy VB6 applications with RFID/barcode integration
- **POS Solutions**: Lightweight, JSON-based systems for small businesses  
- **LabelHive**: Web-to-printer platform solving food industry labeling pain points
- **E-commerce**: Building B2B marketplaces for the Indian market

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages I speak fluently:** VB6, SQL, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and whatever the project demands  
**Databases:** SQL Server, MySQL, JSON stores  
**Hardware Integration:** Barcode/RFID systems, POS terminals, thermal printers  
**Infrastructure:** Web development, e-commerce platforms, legacy system maintenance  

### 🌟 What I Do Best
- **Rapid Technology Adoption**: Give me any new API, IDE, or framework - I'll be productive in days
- **Full-Stack Problem Solving**: From hardware assembly to database design to user interfaces
- **Legacy System Whispering**: Keeping 20+ year old systems running while planning their evolution
- **Cross-Border Collaboration**: Managing distributed teams across time zones

### 📊 My Approach
```javascript
const myWorkStyle = {
  philosophy: "Family first, sustainable pace, continuous learning",
  availability: "UAE evenings + weekends (when family allows 😊)",
  communication: "Async-friendly, documentation-heavy, results-focused",
  problemSolving: "Identify pain points → Build practical solutions → Scale thoughtfully"
}
